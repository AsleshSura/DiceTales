## 🎯 Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Making Choices
The AI presents you with 3-4 action options based on your current situation:

**Example Situation**: *You stand before an ancient, moss-covered door with strange runes carved into its surface.*

**Possible Choices**:
1. **[STR]** Force the door open with brute strength
2. **[INT]** Study the runes to understand their meaning
3. **[DEX]** Search for a hidden mechanism or lockpick
4. **[WIS]** Listen carefully at the door before proceeding

### Dice Rolling System (Turn-Based v2.0)
DiceTales uses a **D20 system** (20-sided dice) with **strategic turn-based rolling**:

#### Turn-Based Rules (NEW)
- **One roll per turn**: You can only roll dice once per turn
- **Strategic timing**: Choose carefully when to use your roll
- **Turn advancement**: Making choices progresses to the next turn
- **Visual indicators**: Dice shows when rolling is available/unavailable

#### When to Roll Dice
- **Combat situations**: Attack rolls, defense rolls
- **Skill challenges**: Climbing, sneaking, knowledge checks
- **Critical moments**: Important story decisions
- **Risky actions**: Breaking down doors, jumping gaps

#### When NOT to Roll
- **Simple choices**: Basic story decisions don't require rolls
- **Already rolled this turn**: Wait for next turn to roll again
- **Low-risk actions**: Safe choices often succeed automatically

#### Basic Roll Mechanics
- **Roll Result** = D20 + Relevant Stat
- **Difficulty Classes (DC)**:
  - **Easy**: DC 10
  - **Medium**: DC 15  
  - **Hard**: DC 20
  - **Extreme**: DC 25

#### Success Levels
- **Critical Failure (1)**: Something goes very wrong
- **Failure (2-9)**: You don't succeed, but learn something
- **Partial Success (10-14)**: You succeed with complications
- **Success (15-19)**: You accomplish your goal
- **Critical Success (20)**: Exceptional outcome with bonuses

### Combat System (Turn-Based)
When combat occurs, the strategic turn system becomes crucial:

#### Combat Turns (v2.0)
1. **Story Phase**: AI describes the combat situation
2. **Choice Phase**: Select your combat action (attack, defend, flee, etc.)
3. **Roll Phase**: If you haven't rolled this turn, you can roll for your action
4. **Resolution**: HuggingFace AI narrates the results
5. **Next Turn**: New choices available, dice resets for next roll

#### Strategic Combat Planning
- **Plan your roll**: Will you use it for attack, defense, or special action?
- **Consider consequences**: Missing your one roll can be costly
- **Read the situation**: AI descriptions hint at best tactics
- **Save rolls for crucial moments**: Sometimes choosing without rolling is wise

#### Combat Options
- **Attack**: STR for melee, DEX for ranged (usually requires roll)
- **Defend**: Focus on protection (may not require roll)
- **Cast Spell**: Use INT or WIS depending on spell type (usually requires roll)
- **Flee**: Use DEX to escape (requires roll, not always possible)
- **Tactical Choice**: Sometimes you can choose actions that don't need dice

## 🎨 Advanced Turn-Based Strategies

### Turn Management Philosophy
In v2.0, every roll matters. Develop these strategic habits:

#### The "Roll or Choose" Decision
**Always ask yourself**: "Do I need to roll for this, or can I succeed through choice alone?"

**Roll when:**
- Combat situations require it
- High-stakes skill challenges
- The AI hints that success is uncertain
- You have a good stat bonus for the situation

**Choose without rolling when:**
- Social situations where your approach matters more than luck
- Low-risk exploration
- You've already rolled this turn
- You want to save your roll for something more important

#### Dice Conservation Strategy
- **Early game**: Use rolls liberally to learn the system
- **Mid game**: Start being selective about when to roll
- **Late game**: Every roll should be calculated and strategic
- **Combat**: Save rolls for critical attack/defense moments

### Tactical Decision Making

#### Reading the Situation
The AI provides clues about the best approach:

**Combat Indicators**:
- "snarling", "weapons drawn", "hostile" → Prepare for fight
- "nervous", "cornered", "desperate" → Maybe try diplomacy first

**Stealth Indicators**:
- "guards patrolling", "shadows", "unaware" → Sneak approach viable
- "well-lit", "open area", "vigilant" → Stealth might be harder

**Social Indicators**:
- "friendly", "curious", "willing to talk" → Diplomacy preferred
- "angry", "prejudiced", "dismissive" → Need high CHA or different approach

#### Risk vs. Reward
- **High-risk actions** often lead to better rewards but severe consequences
- **Safe actions** provide steady progress but fewer opportunities
- **Creative solutions** combining multiple stats often yield unique outcomes

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Gameplay

### When AI Responses Seem Off
- **Context might be lost** - the AI has limited memory
- **Try a different approach** - vary your choice patterns
- **Use the dice** - random elements can reset strange situations
- **Start fresh** if the story becomes incoherent

### When Dice Seem Unfair
- **Streaks happen** - both good and bad luck are normal
- **Adjust strategy** - play to your strengths, avoid weaknesses
- **Remember partial success** - even "failed" rolls advance the story
- **Critical successes** make up for previous failures

### When Stuck in the Story
- **Try unexpected choices** - break patterns
- **Use your weakest stat** - failures create new opportunities
- **Ask questions** through your choices
- **Take risks** - safety can lead to boring loops
