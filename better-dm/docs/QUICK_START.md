## üéØ Campaign Creation Tips

### Writing Effective Campaign Prompts
**Good Examples:**
- Include a central conflict or threat
- Mention the setting/world
- Suggest the tone (dark, heroic, mysterious)
- Hint at the scope (local village vs. entire kingdom)

**Avoid:**
- Vague descriptions ("adventure in a fantasy world")
- Too many unrelated plot elements
- Overly complex scenarios for first campaigns

### Character Information Best Practices
**Include:**
- Character class and level
- Background and motivation
- Personality traits
- Goals and fears
- Any important relationships

**Example Template:**
```
[Name] - [Class] Level [X]
Background: [Previous life/occupation]
Motivation: [What drives them]
Personality: [Key traits]
Goals: [What they want to achieve]
Fears/Flaws: [What holds them back]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Campaign Won't Generate"**
- Ensure your internet connection is stable
- Try a simpler campaign prompt
- Check that your character description isn't empty
- Refresh the page and try again

**"AI Responses Seem Random"**
- Make sure your actions are specific and clear
- Check the current objectives in the sidebar
- Try actions that relate to the current scene goals

**"Page Loads Slowly"**
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Try a different browser if issues persist

### Performance Tips
- Use specific, focused action descriptions
- Keep character descriptions concise but detailed
- Save your campaign regularly (Ctrl+S)

## üéÆ Playing Your First Session

### Understanding the Interface
- **Left Side**: Story text and your conversation with the AI
- **Right Side**: Campaign progress, current objectives, and controls
- **Bottom**: Input area where you type your actions

### Sample Gameplay Flow
1. **Read the scene**: Understand what's happening
2. **Check objectives**: See what you need to accomplish
3. **Plan your action**: Decide what to do next
4. **Type clearly**: Describe your action in detail
5. **React to results**: Adapt based on what happens

### Effective Action Examples
Instead of: "I attack"
Try: "I draw my sword and charge at the goblin, aiming for its chest while trying to stay between it and the innocent villagers."

Instead of: "I look around"
Try: "I carefully scan the ancient library, looking for any books about dragon lore or magical artifacts that might help us."
