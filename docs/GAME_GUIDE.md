3. **Read the opening narrative** generated by AI
4. **Choose your action** from the provided options
5. **Watch your story unfold** based on your choices

### Understanding Your Character

#### Core Statistics
Your character has six primary stats that determine your capabilities:

| Stat | Full Name | What It Does | Examples |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **STR** | Strength | Physical power, melee combat, lifting | Sword fighting, breaking doors, climbing |
| **DEX** | Dexterity | Agility, reflexes, stealth, ranged attacks | Archery, sneaking, dodging, acrobatics |
| **CON** | Constitution | Health, stamina, resistance to damage | Surviving poison, enduring cold, running |
| **INT** | Intelligence | Knowledge, reasoning, spellcasting | Solving puzzles, identifying magic items |
| **WIS** | Wisdom | Perception, insight, intuition | Spotting traps, reading people, survival |
| **CHA** | Charisma | Social skills, leadership, persuasion | Negotiating, inspiring allies, lying |

#### Character Progression
- **Health Points (HP)**: Your life force - if it reaches 0, you face dire consequences
- **Experience Points (XP)**: Gained through successful actions and story progression
- **Level Up**: Every 100 XP, you can increase one stat by 1 point

## üéØ Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Making Choices
The AI presents you with 3-4 action options based on your current situation:

**Example Situation**: *You stand before an ancient, moss-covered door with strange runes carved into its surface.*

**Possible Choices**:
1. **[STR]** Force the door open with brute strength
2. **[INT]** Study the runes to understand their meaning
3. **[DEX]** Search for a hidden mechanism or lockpick
4. **[WIS]** Listen carefully at the door before proceeding

### Dice Rolling System
DiceTales uses a **D20 system** (20-sided dice) for determining success:

#### Basic Roll Mechanics
- **Roll Result** = D20 + Relevant Stat
- **Difficulty Classes (DC)**:
  - **Easy**: DC 10
  - **Medium**: DC 15
  - **Hard**: DC 20
  - **Extreme**: DC 25

#### Success Levels
- **Critical Failure (1)**: Something goes very wrong
- **Failure (2-9)**: You don't succeed, but learn something
- **Partial Success (10-14)**: You succeed with complications
- **Success (15-19)**: You accomplish your goal
- **Critical Success (20)**: Exceptional outcome with bonuses

### Combat System
When combat occurs, the system becomes more tactical:

#### Combat Rounds
1. **Initiative**: DEX determines who acts first
2. **Action Phase**: Choose attack, defend, or special action
3. **Resolution**: Roll dice + relevant stat vs. enemy defense
4. **Damage**: Successful hits reduce HP based on weapon/spell

#### Combat Options
- **Attack**: STR for melee, DEX for ranged
- **Defend**: Increase your defense for this round
- **Cast Spell**: Use INT or WIS depending on spell type
- **Flee**: Use DEX to escape (not always possible)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Gameplay

### When AI Responses Seem Off
- **Context might be lost** - the AI has limited memory
- **Try a different approach** - vary your choice patterns
- **Use the dice** - random elements can reset strange situations
- **Start fresh** if the story becomes incoherent

### When Dice Seem Unfair
- **Streaks happen** - both good and bad luck are normal
- **Adjust strategy** - play to your strengths, avoid weaknesses
- **Remember partial success** - even "failed" rolls advance the story
- **Critical successes** make up for previous failures

### When Stuck in the Story
- **Try unexpected choices** - break patterns
- **Use your weakest stat** - failures create new opportunities
- **Ask questions** through your choices
- **Take risks** - safety can lead to boring loops
