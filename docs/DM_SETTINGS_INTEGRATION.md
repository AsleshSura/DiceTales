# DM Settings Integration - REMOVED

## Status: FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED

The DM Settings functionality has been completely removed from the character creation flow due to implementation complexity and user experience issues.

## What Was Removed

### Character Creation Flow
- Removed `dm_settings` as the 5th step in character creation
- Reverted to original 4-step process: Setting → Class → Stats → Details
- Removed DM Settings step indicator
- Removed DM Settings validation logic

### UI Components  
- Removed `renderDMSettings()` method
- Removed `bindDMSettingsEvents()` method
- Removed DM Settings CSS styles and responsive design
- Removed DM preview card and character summary components

### AI Integration
- Reverted AI system prompt to not use custom DM difficulty or prompts
- Removed references to `campaign.dm_difficulty` and `campaign.dm_custom_prompt`
- Restored original DM personality system using only setting-based hints

### Files Modified
- **js/character.js**: Removed DM Settings step, methods, and validation
- **css/character.css**: Removed all DM Settings related styles
- **js/ai.js**: Reverted to original system prompt without custom DM settings
- **index.html**: Cleaned up debug scripts

## Current State
The character creation process now follows the original 4-step flow:
1. **Campaign Setting**: Choose your adventure setting
2. **Character Class**: Select your character's profession  
3. **Ability Scores**: Allocate points using point-buy system
4. **Character Details**: Name, background, and personality traits

The AI DM uses the default personality hints defined in each campaign setting without user customization options.

## Technical Details
- DM settings are stored in `campaign.dm_difficulty` and `campaign.dm_custom_prompt`
- Default difficulty is 'medium' if not explicitly set
- Settings are available to the AI system when `aiManager.startCampaign()` is called
- **UPDATED**: Validation only requires name and background for character details step
- Personality traits are optional but still available for users who want detailed characters

## Testing
- Added debug script (`debug-dm-settings.js`) for testing
- Use `testDMSettings()` in browser console to jump directly to DM Settings step
- Use `debugCharacterCreation()` to check current character creation status
