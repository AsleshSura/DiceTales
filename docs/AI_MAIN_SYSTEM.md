# DiceTales Main AI System Documentation

## Overview

The Main AI System (`advanced/js/ai.js`) is the core storytelling engine of DiceTales, powered by HuggingFace's advanced language models. This system provides human-like conversational AI with comprehensive memory integration, plot grounding, and dynamic storytelling capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **AIManager Class**: Primary AI coordination and management
- **HuggingFace Integration**: Modern conversational models for human-like responses
- **Memory Integration**: Seamless connection with Memory Manager for context
- **Response Enhancement**: Post-processing for immersive storytelling
- **Model Fallback System**: Robust model switching for reliability

### Model Priority Queue

The system uses a prioritized list of HuggingFace models:

1. `microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq` - Primary conversational AI
2. `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` - Optimized dialogue generation
3. `microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-base-seq2seq` - Balanced performance model
4. `facebook/blenderbot-1B-distill` - Large-scale conversational model
5. `microsoft/DialoGPT-large` - Proven conversational model
6. `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` - Medium-sized reliable model
7. `gpt2-large` / `distilgpt2` - General purpose fallback models

## Key Features

### ü§ñ Human-Like Conversational AI

**Advanced Models**: Uses state-of-the-art conversational models specifically designed for natural dialogue generation.

**Context Integration**: Builds comprehensive prompts including:
- Character stats, equipment, and current health
- Past decisions and their consequences  
- NPC relationships and interaction history
- Discovered locations and world state
- Active plot threads for story continuity

### üí≠ Enhanced Response Processing

**Quality Enhancement Pipeline**:
1. **Context Assembly**: Builds comprehensive prompt with character and memory data
2. **API Request**: Sends request to HuggingFace models with fallback handling
3. **Response Enhancement**: Cleans and enhances raw AI output for immersion
4. **Memory Extraction**: Automatically extracts important information for storage
5. **Display Processing**: Formats response for game interface display

**Meta-Commentary Filtering**: Removes AI artifacts and improves immersion:
- Filters out planning statements and meta-analysis
- Removes system-level commentary
- Enhances descriptive language
- Maintains proper narrative voice

### üß† Memory System Integration

**Comprehensive Context Building**:
```javascript
üé≠ CHARACTER PROFILE: [Name, Class, Level, Background, Current Status]
üìä ABILITY SCORES: [STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA with current values]
‚ù§Ô∏è HEALTH STATUS: [Current/Max HP, conditions, injuries]
üéí INVENTORY: [Equipped items, carried equipment, special items]
üß† RECENT DECISIONS: [Last 3 significant choices and consequences]
üë• KEY RELATIONSHIPS: [Important NPCs and relationship status]
üîç DISCOVERIES: [Recent findings and their significance]
üéØ SKILLS USED: [Frequently used skills and success patterns]
üìñ ACTIVE PLOTS: [Current story threads and objectives]
üó∫Ô∏è LOCATION CONTEXT: [Current area and relevant locations]
```

**Automatic Information Tracking**:
- Detects new NPCs and tracks relationships
- Records location descriptions for consistency
- Monitors quest progression and objectives
- Tracks inventory changes and item acquisition
- Identifies skill usage patterns

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

**Conversation Settings**:
```javascript
conversationConfig: {
    maxContextLength: 2048,
    temperature: 0.8,
    topP: 0.9,
    repetitionPenalty: 1.1,
    maxNewTokens: 150,
    doSample: true,
    numBeams: 3
}
```

**Memory Configuration**:
```javascript
memoryConfig: {
    maxConversationHistory: 20,
    plotContextWindow: 5,
    characterMemoryDepth: 10
}
```

## API Reference

### Constructor
```javascript
const aiManager = new AIManager();
```

### Core Methods

#### `async initialize()`
Initializes the AI system and tests model connections.
```javascript
await aiManager.initialize();
```

#### `async startCampaign()`
Starts a new campaign with initial story generation.
```javascript
await aiManager.startCampaign();
```

#### `async processPlayerAction(actionData)`
Processes player actions and generates AI responses.
```javascript
await aiManager.processPlayerAction({
    action: "Search the ancient ruins",
    type: "exploration",
    diceRoll: { result: 15, sides: 20 }
});
```

#### `buildMemoryContext(character, campaign)`
Builds comprehensive memory context for AI prompts.
```javascript
const context = aiManager.buildMemoryContext(character, campaign);
```

#### `async callAI(messages)`
Makes API calls to HuggingFace models with fallback system.
```javascript
const response = await aiManager.callAI([
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful DM.' },
    { role: 'user', content: 'What happens next?' }
]);
```

### Testing and Debugging

#### Browser Console Functions
```javascript
// Test AI response system
testAI()

// Test specific player action
testPlayerAction("examine the room")

// Test memory system functionality
testMemory()

// Toggle fallback mode for testing
enableFallbackMode()
disableFallbackMode()
```

## Setting-Specific Storytelling
