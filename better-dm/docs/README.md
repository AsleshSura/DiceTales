   - **Input Area**: Where you describe your actions
   - **Sidebar**: Campaign progress and roadmap overview
   - **Roadmap Panel**: Detailed view of the entire campaign structure

2. **Taking Actions**
   - Type your desired action in the input field
   - Press Enter or click "Take Action"
   - Watch as the AI responds with roadmap awareness
   - Observe automatic progress tracking

3. **Monitoring Progress**
   - **Current Chapter/Scene**: Always visible in the sidebar
   - **Objectives**: Current scene goals and requirements

## Advanced Features

### Campaign Roadmap Adaptation

The system intelligently adapts the roadmap when players make unexpected choices:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes when player actions deviate from expected paths
2. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluates how choices affect the overall story
3. **Smart Adaptation**: Modifies upcoming scenes while maintaining story coherence
4. **Emergency Scenarios**: Provides backup content for completely unexpected situations

### AI Response Signals

The AI uses special signals to communicate with the system:

- `[SCENE_COMPLETE]`: Indicates current scene objectives are met
- `[CHAPTER_ADVANCE]`: Suggests moving to the next chapter
- `[ROADMAP_UPDATE]`: Triggers roadmap adaptation
- `[EMERGENCY_MODE]`: Activates emergency scenario handling

### Save and Export System

**Campaign Saving:**
- Complete campaign state preservation
- Roadmap progress and adaptations
- Full conversation history
- Character progression data

**Export Options:**
- Campaign logs in text format
- Roadmap structure as JSON
- Progress reports and statistics

## Configuration Options

### AI Configuration (`betterDMAI.js`)

```javascript
aiConfig: {
  models: ['microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq', ...],
  temperature: 0.8,        // Response creativity (0.1-1.0)
  maxTokens: 300,          // Response length limit
  maxRetries: 3            // Retry attempts on failure
}
```

### Roadmap Configuration (`campaignRoadmap.js`)

```javascript
roadmapTemplate: {
  estimatedSessions: 6,    // Default campaign length
  difficultyProgression: 'gradual', // 'gradual', 'steep', 'plateau'
  maxHistoryLength: 15     // Conversation memory limit
}
```

### UI Configuration (`betterDMApp.js`)

```javascript
// Modify these values to customize the interface
maxRecentResponses: 5,    // Number of recent responses to track
actionDebounceTime: 2000, // Milliseconds between actions
autoSaveInterval: 300000  // Auto-save every 5 minutes
```

## Best Practices

### For Campaign Creation

1. **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts generate better roadmaps
2. **Include Character Motivation**: Personal stakes improve story integration
3. **Set Clear Themes**: Consistent themes lead to better narrative coherence
4. **Consider Player Agency**: Leave room for player choice and creativity

### For Playing Campaigns

1. **Engage with Objectives**: Work toward scene goals for best experience
2. **Be Descriptive**: Detailed actions receive richer responses
3. **Embrace Adaptation**: The system adapts to your choices - be creative!
4. **Monitor Progress**: Check the roadmap to understand story direction

### For DMs Using the System

1. **Review Generated Roadmaps**: Modify or guide the AI if needed
2. **Watch for Adaptation Points**: Observe how player choices affect the story
3. **Use Emergency Scenarios**: Don't worry about players going off-track
4. **Save Regularly**: Preserve good campaign states for reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Campaign Won't Generate:**
- Check internet connection for AI API calls
- Verify campaign prompt is descriptive enough
- Try different theme/difficulty combinations

**AI Responses Seem Off-Topic:**
- Review current scene objectives
- Check if roadmap adaptation is needed
- Try more specific action descriptions

**Progress Not Updating:**
- Ensure scene objectives are being met
- Look for completion signals in responses
- Manually advance if stuck

### Performance Optimization

**For Better Response Times:**
- Use shorter, more focused prompts
- Reduce conversation history length
- Consider simpler campaign themes

**For Better Roadmap Quality:**
- Provide detailed character backgrounds
- Include specific setting preferences
- Use consistent terminology throughout
